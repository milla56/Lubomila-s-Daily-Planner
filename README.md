## Description

"Lubomila's Daily Planner" calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs into the browser and features HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Moment Js.

## Installation

Follow the link for the deployed website [Daily-Planner](https://milla56.github.io/Lubomila-s-Daily-Planner/) 

## Usage
The list shows what steps were made to complete the challenge:
 - Once the planner is open, the user can see the current day at the top of the calendar.
 ![DATE](./screenshots/date.png)
 - To display the current date I used Moment.js library.
 - Scrolling down to the planner, the user will be able to see the time blocks for standard business hours (9am - 5pm).
 - Depending on when the time block is viewed, the color code for each time block is different based on past, present and future.
 - The users are allowed to enter an event when they click a timelock.

 - The event will be saved when the "save button" is clicked.
 - If the page is refreshed, the events still will be saved.

 - To make the app more personalised, I created an individua color palette.
